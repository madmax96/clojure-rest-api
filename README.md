## REST API in Clojure
 This project represents simple REST api made with clojure and it's libs,
 primarily intended to be used by instagram-like, image sharing, social applications. 
 One such application, that actually uses this API can be found here: https://github.com/madmax96/ionic-image-sharing-app

 API supports basic user registration and  authentication, users can upload profile pictures,
 make image posts with description, delete their posts, view other users profiles and like other users posts,
 view some statistics about their posts, etc..

 API could be developed further to support for example commenting on posts, liking comments,
 real-time notifications (via websocket protocol) for some app events like for example when someone comments or likes user's post etc..
